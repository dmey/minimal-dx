! Description
! This module is meant as a wrapper for the `PsyTsatFnHPb` function as it is missing from PsychroLib.
! The `PsyTsatFnHPb` function was copied and pasted from the following link:
! https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlusRelease/blob/1ba84749/SourceCode/PsychRoutines.f90#L2331-L2542
!
! Changes
! The following changes were made to the`Â§PsyTsatFnHPb` function:
! - D. Meyer (20190112): replace EnergyPlus function `PsyHFnTdbW` and
!   `PsyWFnTdbTwbPb` with `GetSatAirEnthalpy` from PsychroLib.
! - D. Meyer (20190112): remove unused preprocessing directives.
